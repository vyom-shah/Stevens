                <p>
                    Learning is a perennial process of life because we can keep learning on each successive day if we want. Bolstering the thought, 
                    I wish that before implementing my rudimentary knowledge of computer science in the real world, I must have abstract as well as concrete 
                    knowledge in the subject of my interests. Computer Science has always ruled the technological revolution and the fact that humans can make 
                    computers do almost anything which they wish, inspired me to take Computer Engineering as the field of study. I opted for computer science 
                    from 11th Grade and since then the idea to pursue my career in the field of computer science emerged.

                    During my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering, I seized every opportunity to delve into different sub-disciplines of computer engineering
                    by taking courses and attending workshops.
